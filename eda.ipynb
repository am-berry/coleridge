      "section title abstract text cognitive deficits and reduced educational achievement are common in psychiatric illness understanding the genetic basis of cognitive and educational deficits may be informative about the etiology of psychiatric disorders a recent large genomewide association study gwas reported a genome wide significant locus for years of education which subsequently demonstrated association to general cognitive ability g in overlapping cohorts the current study was designed to test whether gwas hits for educational attainment are involved in general cognitive ability in an independent large scale collection of cohorts using cohorts in the cognitive genomics consortium cogent up to 20 495 healthy individuals we examined the relationship between g and variants associated with educational attainment we next conducted meta analyses with 24 189 individuals with neurocognitive data from the educational attainment studies and then with 53 188 largely independent individuals from a recent gwas of cognition a snp rs1906252 located at chromosome 6q16 1 previously associated with years of schooling was significantly associated with g p 1 47 10 4 in cogent the first joint analysis of 43 381 non overlapping individuals for this a priori designated locus was strongly significant p 4 94 10 7 and the second joint analysis of 68 159 non overlapping individuals was even more robust p 1 65 10 9 these results provide independent replication in a large scale dataset of a genetic locus associated with cognitive function and education as sample sizes grow cognitive gwas will identify increasing numbers of associated loci as has been accomplished in other polygenic quantitative traits which may be relevant to psychiatric illness section title introduction text a general cognitive ability factor also termed g typically captures just under half of the overall variance in performance on diverse laboratory measures of neurocognitive functioning general performance on neurocognitive tests has remarkable predictive value across a diverse range of social health and behavioral outcomes more so than any other psychological trait gottfredson 1997 deary et al 2011 deary 2012 as examples low g performance is associated with lower educational attainment and income is a better predictor of mortality from cardiovascular disease than smoking blood glucose and cholesterol deary 2008 and predicts longevity batty et al 2008 deficits in general neurocognitive performance are pervasive in most psychiatric and neurologic disorders yet are often the most difficult component to treat millan et al 2012 as such understanding the neurobiology of human cognition is potentially critical to improving physical and mental health outcomes in society deary et al 2010 while both genetic background and environmental experience interact to shape cognitive development twin and family studies have consistently demonstrated heritability of more than 50 for general cognitive ability measured in adulthood allelic variation can have a direct influence on brain biology by modifying the molecular structure and or function of brain expressed transcripts and proteins such as neurotransmitter receptors and neurodevelopmental growth factors chen et al 2004 however attempts to pinpoint loci associated with human cognition across diverse population samples have proven challenging due to the difficulty of assembling the large cohorts required to detect small expected effects of individual variants in a highly polygenic trait benyamin et al 2014 chabris et al 2012 luciano et al 2011 lencz et al 2013 need et al 2009 davies et al 2011 davies et al 2015 martin et al 2011 by contrast educational history is easily obtainable demographic information collected in any field of medical research and can therefore be collected in more readily across large cohorts as compared to cognition educational attainment as measured by self reported years of schooling has been proposed as a proxy phenotype for cognitive ability for gwas since much larger samples can be utilized compared to neurocognitive studies rietveld et al 2014a rietveld et al 2014b rietveld et al 2013 martin et al 2011 the social science genetic association consortium ssgac reported on a 126 559 person gwas that detected three genome wide significant snps associated with completion of college rs11584700 and rs4851266 and years of schooling rs9320913 rietveld et al 2013 in a post hoc analysis these snps had a stronger and more direct effect on cognitive function than on education rietveld et al 2013 further a polygenic risk score of educational attainment snps accounted for 2 3 of the variance in general cognitive ability an in independent sample and a mediation analysis suggested that g mediated more than half of the effect these snps had on education rietveld et al 2013 here we analyzed the three snps obtained in the ssgac educational attainment gwas in 20 000 independent subjects in the cognitive genomics consortium cogent donohoe et al 2012 lencz et al 2013 and found converging evidence across multiple large cohorts that common variation at genomic region 6q16 1 previously associated with years of schooling reliably predicts variation in g section title methods and materials text cogent is an international gwas collaboration formed to conduct genetic analyses of g and related neurocognitive processes in healthy individuals donohoe et al 2012 though common gwas markers have been proposed to account for 30 or more of the variance in general intelligence in adults individual snps only contribute a small fraction of the variance to the heritability of g due to extreme polygenicity marioni et al 2014 detecting snp associations of such small magnitudes via gwas requires large samples many times the size an individual lab can ascertain leading to consortia such as cogent the decision to study g in cogent stemmed from longstanding evidence that a g factor can be derived consistently captures almost half the variance in overall test performance and is relatively invariant to the neurocognitive test battery used and specific abilities assessed panizzon et al 2014 the first phase of cogent cogent1 resulted in a gwas of general cognitive ability in 5 000 individuals from the general population lencz et al 2013 the next and ongoing wave of data collection in cogent cogent2 has resulted in the acquisition of 15 000 independent subjects with neurocognitive and gwas data for analysis see table 1 for cohort details to be included as a participant in cogent data from at least one neuropsychological measure across at least three domains of cognitive performance e g digit span for working memory logical memory for verbal declarative memory and digit symbol coding for processing speed or the use of a validated g sensitive measure was required tests missing for more than 5 of the sample in an individual study were excluded each cogent study administered an average of 10 3 neurocognitive tests and the internal consistency of performance within each study was strong mean cronbach s alpha 75 supplementary table s1 the first unrotated principal component accounted for just under half of the variance across the 21 studies on average as expected based on an extensive prior literature carroll 1993 as figure 1 shows g had normal distributional properties within all 21 studies a feature critical to enhancing statistical power in quantitative trait analysis all cogent samples were genotyped on commercial illumina or affymetrix genome wide snp microarrays supplementary table s1 standard gwas quality control qc methods were applied to the genetic data described in detail in the supplementary information subjects in the study were caucasian of european ancestry which we confirmed by analysis of genotype data using multidimensional scaling mds genetic outliers were removed in each study based on mds axis plotting versus hapmap3 ethnic subgroups note that none of the three snps previously associated with education were variants included on commercially available microarrays and thus were imputed into their datasets rietveld et al 2013 in the cogent1 studies snps were imputed using hapmap3 reference panels as previously described lencz et al 2013 cogent2 samples that did not have genotypes for the snps of interest were imputed using impute2 howie et al 2009 and 1000 genomes project reference panels downloaded june 2014 section title 2011 plink was used to analyze datasets comprising unrelated individuals text and gcta used to analyze five datasets in which multiple family members were known to be included a priori gcta has implemented a mixed linear model association mlma analytic function that corrects for population or relatedness structure through a correction that is specific to the structure of interest regression coefficients and standard error estimates were generated within each study and then carried forward for meta analysis using metasoft han and eskin 2011 and the r metabel package aulchenko et al 2007 for plotting of results although we expected that allelic effects for cognitive ability would mirror the direction observed for educational attainment all analyses were conservatively carried out using two tailed tests a multi stage approach was utilized to determine if gwas hits associated with educational attainment were also associated with general cognitive ability in cogent first we examined the p values of the three educational attainment snps and their close proxies in the database housing the results of the cogent1 gwas lencz et al 2013 snps with pvalues 05 identified in this first stage were then meta analyzed for association to g in 16 000 independent subjects in the subsequent replication stage section title results text section title cogent analysis text using the approach described above the two snps previously associated with the dichotomous variable of completing college rs11584700 and rs4851266 in rietveld et al 2013 were not significantly associated with g in cogent1 p s 05 the third snp rs9320913 associated with years of schooling was neither genotyped nor imputed in cogent1 however a close proxy snp rs1906252 r 2 1 0 in hapmap2 ceu r 2 905 in 1000 genomes ceu was available for analysis in the cogent1 gwas data rs1906252 was either typed or imputed in all nine cogent1 studies and was significantly associated with general cognitive ability in the expected direction such that the minor a allele was associated with higher g scores 050 p 1 20 10 2 p q 340 this snp was therefore carried forward for analysis in cogent2 to date gwas and neurocognitive data have been acquired for more than 15 000 participants from 12 independent cohorts in cogent2 the average sample size of individual cogent2 studies was 1 398 and ranged from 127 to 4 412 caucasian subjects of european ancestry rs1906252 was genotyped or imputed in all 12 cogent2 samples n 16 544 genotypes of which 15 533 had g factor data as shown in table 2 the association between allelic variation at snp rs1906252 and g in cogent2 was statistically significant and not biased by heterogeneity 027 p 2 34 10 3 two tailed p q 671 the direction of the minor allele effect was positive in 10 out of 12 cogent2 studies which was consistent with the educational attainment gwas studies and cogent1 and statistically different from chance binomial test p 02 finally all 21 cogent datasets were merged to analyze the association between rs1906252 and g in the combined sample of 20 495 individuals a significant association was again detected in the combined analysis that was not confounded by heterogeneity 031 p 1 47 10 4 two tailed p q 543 figure 2 presents the combined results in a forest plot and as shown in figure 3 a linear increase in general cognitive ability was related positively to minor a allele load we tested the robustness of the association between rs1906252 and g in a series of sensitivity analyses first a potential confound worthy of consideration was the fact that two cogent1 studies helsinki birth cohort study hbcs n 332 and the 1936 lothian birth cohort study lbc1936 n 1 005 lencz et al 2013 were also included in ssgac rietveld et al 2014b rietveld et al 2013 the non independence of our collective studies and the high correlation between educational attainment and cognition necessitated a sensitivity analysis requiring hbcs and lbc1936 be excluded and the remaining cogent studies reanalyzed this analysis also yielded a significant result between variation in rs1906252 and g 026 p 1 60 10 3 two tailed p q 889 see table 2 next age had a bimodal distribution across the 21 cogent studies the first peak was at approximately 18 years of age and the second peak at approximately 70 years supplemental figure s1 to explore the effect of age on the association between rs1906252 and g across the lifespan we examined the interaction between rs1906252 and age on g which was not significant 0004 p 302 we then split the sample at the valley of the distribution at age 40 this resulted in a group of 7 208 individuals under 40 years of age and a group of 13 287 individuals 40 years of age or older the interaction between rs1906252 and this dichotomous age split was not significant 007 p 728 thus age did not moderate the association between rs1906252 and general cognitive function across the lifespan in cogent section title ssgac meta analysis text the ssgac reanalyzed their gwas data utilizing a two stage design in order to examine whether educational attainment is a valid proxy phenotype for cognitive ability rietveld et al 2014b subjects with available neurocognitive data n 24 189 were removed from the larger cohort and a gwas of years of education was then conducted in the remaining 106k participants stage 1 the top 69 snps associated with educational attainment were then carried forward for analysis in relation to cognitive performance in the 24k subsample stage 2 in stage 1 the chromosome 6q16 1 locus previously associated with years of schooling was again genome wide significant for educational attainment although the top snp at this locus was slightly different rs9320913 in the original gwas and rs1487441 in the second gwas r 2 9 between the two snps in stage 2 rs1487441 was the snp most strongly associated with cognitive performance p 1 24 10 4 notably rs1487441 is a perfect proxy for our snp rs1906252 r 2 1 in both hapmap and 1000 genomes thus we sought to integrate our current results with the most recent ssgac findings as shown in table 3 we performed a meta analysis of the ssgac cognitive subcohort with our fully independent cogent cohorts lbc1936 and hbcs were part of the ssgac studies so they were excluded for this particular analysis however this was a conservative approach since i lbc1936 was included in the cognitive performance sample as part of the childhood intelligence consortium which used age 11 cognitive phenotypes for lbc1936 whereas lbc1936 adult phenotypes were included in cogent and ii hbcs was not included in the ssgac cognitive analysis only the educational attainment gwas rietveld et al 2014b with a total sample size of 43 381 non duplicated individuals across ssgac and cogent the association between this locus and g had an estimated effect size of 031 p 4 94 10 7 section title charge meta analysis text a gwas of general cognitive function that included 53 000 individuals from 31 population based cohorts was recently published by the cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology charge consortium davies et al 2015 the study reported genome wide significant snp associations with general cognitive ability in three genomic regions including rs1906252 p 1 55 10 8 we sought to integrate the cogent findings with the charge findings as well and conducted a second metaanalysis of rs1906252 and g in this analytic series the cogent samples were fully independent from both the ssgac and the charge samples in other words we excluded hbcs and lbc1936 as above and excluded additional data from our framingham heart study second generation cohort fhs sample the cardiovascular health study chs sample and the norwegian cognitive neurogenetics ncng sample all of which overlapped with charge to some extent in the reduced cogent sample of 16 sites and 15 000 subjects fully independent from ssgac and charge rs1906252 retained a significant association to g 022 p 2 81 10 2 further the joint analysis of the 42 independent cogent and charge cohorts n 68 000 was robust 029 p 1 65 10 9 section title conclusions text the current study identified a significant association of a snp at chromosome 6q16 1 with general cognitive ability across 21 well characterized international samples of europeanancestry individuals from the general population sensitivity analysis suggested that the association between rs1906252 and g was significant independent of the previously published cohorts from the educational attainment gwas moreover the strength of the association was not affected by age of the subjects in cogent the direction of association with g was consistent with the association to self reported educational attainment in the ssgac with more copies of the minor a allele linked to better performance on objectivelymeasured sub traits that comprise general cognitive ability based on the commonly used formula thorleifsson et al 2009 r 2 2f 1 f a 2 where f is the allele frequency 0 47 in this instance and a is the additive effect as measured by standardized beta the independent cogent cohort produces an estimated effect size of r 2 0382 table 3 this effect size estimate is slightly more than half the value obtained in the ssgac cognitive subcohort this is probably due at least in part to the winner s curse phenomenon in which initial observations produce inflated effects by chance zollner and pritchard 2007 the present report provides the first estimate of the effect size that is fully independent of the initial discovery cohort this effect size is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the largest allelic effect sizes observed for other complex polygenic traits such as height or weight visscher et al 2012 wood et al 2014 possibly due to the inherent noise and heterogeneity in the construction of the g phenotype however the success of gwas for height and weight provide optimism that future larger gwas of cognitive ability will prove increasingly successful at identifying significant associations for example the first study reporting a genome wide significant qtl for height weedon et al 2007 had power of only 3 2 to detect the hmga2 locus based on the effect size estimate later derived from an independent cohort that was an order of magnitude larger lango allen et al 2010 similarly subsequent height gwas weedon et al 2008 remained underpowered by conventional criteria 1 80 to detect even the strongest loci yet were still able to obtain genome wide significance for multiple loci including those for which power was 1 this pattern applies to all polygenic complex traits due to the very large number of loci that are available to be detected especially given that the number of associated loci tends to increase very rapidly as effect sizes drop functionally rs1906252 is about 700 kilobases from the nearest annotated gene but it is in an intron of a long intergenic non coding rna lincrna transcript id rp11 436d23 1 gene id loc101927335 ensembl gene id ensg00000271860 that is expressed in human brain tissue based on searches in brainspan http www brainspan org and geneprof halbritter et al 2012 http www geneprof org in order to identify potential regulatory elements at this genomic locus we interrogated rs1906252 using haploreg v3 ward and kellis 2012 while rs1906252 is unannotated it is in nearly perfect ld r 2 99 with rs77910749 which is highly conserved by both gerp and siphy computations is a dnase hypersensitivity site in fetal brain and serves as a weak enhancer or transcription start site across multiple brain tissues notably rs1906252 was recently reported to be a genome wide significant variant associated with bipolar disorder m hleisen et al 2014 again providing evidence of the important overlap of general cognitive ability and psychiatric illness the primary finding of our previous cogent study was a significant polygenic overlap between snps for general cognitive ability and schizophrenia lencz et al 2013 additionally rs1906252 was among the top findings though not significant after correction for multiple comparisons in an earlier gwas of processing speed based on performance on the symbol search test conducted in part in the lbc1936 cohort most recently rs1906252 and 10 other snps in this region were associated with general cognitive function in a gwas of 53 000 subjects at a threshold considered to reach genome wide significance davies et al 2015 in summary the current study provides an independent replication of a link between genetic variation at rs1906252 and neurocognitive ability results also provide evidence that the proxy phenotype approach of using educational attainment as an indirect measure of cognitive ability for gwas has external validity section title supplementary material text refer to web version on pubmed central for supplementary
